                    <h6>The rise of factories and people's search for employment led many individuals to cities which contributed to the rapid growth of population in cities. While cities expanded, the living conditions deteriorated. Cities had unpaved streets that were filled with garbage. Many diseases such as cholera spread easily as families shared one windowless and unsanitary room. Working conditions were also poor as the workers had long shifts where they had unsanitary and dangerous conditions, which often led to many machine-caused injuries. During the revolution, many women and children were assigned to be coal miners, where they inhaled coal dust which introduced many dangerous diseases such as the black lung disease. Many workers were treated poorly in the textile industry and had very threatening environments. According to an interview with John Birley in 1849, a textile factory worker revealed he was beaten senselessly, worked long demanding shifts, and threatened to hide truths from inspection officers. During this time period, many factory managers and owners would threaten the workers to put on a facade when the inspection officers were at the factory. During the revolution, the working class's jobs were slowly being overtaken by machines. This led to many outraged workers, and as a result, formed groups known as the Luddites. The Luddites retaliated by destroying many of the machines and factories. The common occurrence of retaliations had pressured the British Parliament to mandate the factories to improve the workers' working and living environments. During this period, the middle and upper class had thrived as they had vital roles that included factory managers, government employees, doctors, and lawyers.

                    <h6>As energy sources began to evolve, new developments were made. Human and animal power evolved into water and windmills, while giant water wheels and coal-fueled the development of the steam engine. As a result of these energy sources, factories were built, resulting in the Textile Industry, which was one factor driving the revolution. The Spinning Jenny, Arkwright's Water Frame, and the Cotton Gin were among the many inventions created during the revolution. Transportation advancements allowed for the channeling of information and an increase in trade. The British government supported all of the new forms of transportation and roadways, such as turnpikes, canals, and bridges, as they helped boost the economy. The first significant rail line was from Liverpool to Manchester, allowing civilians to travel easily. Another advancement was the steam locomotive, which prompted railroad construction. The new means of transportation reduced the cost of travel and transporting items, which encouraged people to travel and ship cargo.

                    <h6>Britain's abundance of natural resources and a stable government that supported new changes helped the quick uprise of the industrial revolution. The government encouraged internal trade and helped build roads, canals, and harbors. During the beginning, as Britain was the only country with the new technologies and had mass-produced goods for consumers, they had control over the prices of the manufactured items; this led to a monopoly on inventions as the colonies had only a few options to buy goods.

                    <h6>The Industrial Revolution began with the core principles of <b>capitalism</b>. Capitalism benefited the business owners and the wealthy and created a fast-paced economy. The free trade and market encouraged growth, allowing for more competition between business owners. With the growth in competition, businesses expanded, allowing for more employment for the people. The downside to this open market was no government involvement, which led to monopolies that allowed certain businesses to capture the market. Due to the monopolies, there was an increasing gap between the rich and poor. The poor did not do as well under a capitalistic system as they often worked under people and were often underpaid for their work.

                    <h6><b>Socialism</b> during the industrial revolution was sparked because of the uprise in revolts led by factory workers, women, and journalists trying to create better environments for mainly the lower class. Socialism promoted an incentive for innovations; it allowed for a more active and efficient community. The government was more supportive, as the distribution of wealth gave the lower classes a chance to become economically stable. Although socialism benefited the poor, it was made so that businesses could not grow large enough to monopolize the market. The control over businesses did not make businesses strive as rapidly, leading to a slower but growing economy.</h6>

                    <h6><b>Communism</b> is a form of extreme socialism. A theory of Communism was that all working-class men would unite and fight against the Bourgeoisie, and the working class will win and create an equal society. Karl Marx, the founder of Marxism, believed that there should be no social classes and that social classes are the reasons for struggle. Marx also believed Communism made sure that everyone had the means to survive; this allowed for safer working conditions and no social class inequality. The government was very involved with the distribution of resources. Although everyone was equal in society, many of the fundamental freedoms were abolished, such as the freedom of religion. The abolishment of many freedoms often led to a lack of individuality among the population.</h6>

                            <h6>We think a socialist society delivers the best for the community. The merit-based awarding system ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to achieve in life. This is in contrast to communism, which would bond citizens and prevent them from developing their own identities. For a capitalist society, we can use real examples during the beginning of the revolution. We believe that the English textile industries had very poor working conditions for the working class, and the factory managers and owners would go to great extents to hide the working environments from the government. "Frank once thrashed me till he terrified himself," said a factory worker in the factory worker DBQ. “He believed he'd killed me," describes how one of the mill owner's sons battered the worker nearly to death, demonstrating how terribly the working class was treated. When some inspectors arrived at the factory, the workers were washed up and forced to answer "as [they] had been told, not daring to do anything else, knowing what would happen if [they] told them the truth," demonstrating the factory supervisors' never-ending efforts to protect themselves and the factory from being exposed on their brutality. When the doctor says in the Factory Life DBQ, "Last summer I visited three cotton factories with Dr. Clough of Preston and Mr. Barker of Manchester, and we could not remain ten minutes in the factory without gasping for breath," this demonstrates the poor working conditions in multiple factories, not just one, implying that most of the factories' working conditions were extremely harsh. The doctor also notes that they couldn't stay inside the factory for more than 10 minutes, however, the workers stay inside for multiple hours on a regular basis, implying that the workers' health is jeopardized while working in the factory. Overall, this indicates how business owners often exploited the lack of government involvement in a capitalist society. The advantage some owners took because of the lack of government involvement often encouraged owners to misuse the workers in order to maximize the amount of work done in less time in order to save money. Once again, because of the free environment and no law enforcement, and the ease at which data may be manipulated, we feel that the capitalist system is to blame for the bad treatment of the working class and that a socialist society would be the best because of the governments’ presence on businesses and people.
