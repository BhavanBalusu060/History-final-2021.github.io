                    <h6>The surplus supply of food caused an increase in the population during this time period. Consequently, there were more people and less employment, allowing individuals to have free time. This caused many to "tinker," creating new inventions and ideas. In the process, many of these inventions have contributed to the rise of industrialization. </h6>

                    <h6>The rapid increase in population caused the growth of cities. While cities expanded, the living conditions deteriorated. Cities had unpaved streets that were filled with garbage. Many diseases such as cholera spread as families shared one windowless and unsanitary room. Working conditions were also poor as the workers had very long shifts, unsanitary and dangerous environments where machines caused many injuries. During the revolution, many women and children were assigned to be coal miners, where they inhaled coal dust which introduced many dangerous diseases such as the black lung disease. Under the textile industry, many of the workers were treated very poorly. According to an interview with John Birley in 1849, a worker in a textile factory revealed he was beaten senselessly, worked long, demanding shifts, served low-quality food, and was threatened to hide truths to inspection officers. During this period, the middle class had thrived as they also had vital roles that included factory managers, government employees, doctors, and lawyers. During the Industrial Revolution, the working class's jobs were slowly being overtaken by machines. This made many workers angry and created groups known as the Luddites. The Luddites retaliated by destroying many of the machines and factories. The retaliations had made the Senate mandate the factories to improve the workers' working and living environments.

                    <h6>As energy sources began to evolve, new developments were made. Human and animal power evolved into water and windmills, while giant water wheels and coal-fueled the development of the steam engine. As a result of these energy sources, factories were built, resulting in the Textile Industry, which was one of the factors that were driving the revolution. The Spinning Jenny, Arkwright's Water Frame, and the Cotton Gin were among the many inventions created during the revolution. Transportation advancements allowed for the channeling of information and an increase in trade, all of these new forms of transportation and roadways, such as turnpikes, canals, and bridges, were supported by the British government as they would boost the economy. The first significant rail line was from Liverpool to Manchester, allowing civilians to travel easily. Another advancement was the steam locomotive, which prompted railroad construction.

                    <h6>Britain's abundance of natural resources and a stable government that supported new changes helped the quick uprise of industrialization. The government encouraged internal trade and helped build roads, canals, and harbors. As Britain was the only country with the new technologies and mass-produced, they had control over the prices of the manufactured items; this led to a monopoly on inventions as the colonies had only a few options to buy goods.

                    <h6>The Industrial Revolution began with the core principles of <b>capitalism</b>. The free trade and market encouraged growth, allowing for more competition between business owners. With the growth in competition, businesses expanded, allowing for more employment for the people. The downside to this open market was no government involvement, which led to monopolies that allowed certain businesses to capture the market. Due to the monopolies, there was an increasing gap between the rich and poor.</h6>

                    <h6><b>Socialism</b> during the industrial revolution was sparked because of the uprising in revolts led by factory workers, women, journalists who were trying to create better environments among the lower classes. Socialism promoted an incentive for innovations; it allowed for a more active and efficient community. The government was more supportive, as the distribution of wealth gave the lower classes a chance to become economically stable. Although socialism benefited the poor, it made it so that businesses could not grow large enough to monopolize the market.</h6>

                    <h6><b>Communism </b>is a form of extreme socialism. A theory of Communism was that all working-class men would unite and fight against the Bourgeoisie, and the working class will win and create an equal society. Karl Marx, the founder of Marxism, believed that there should be no social classes and that social classes are the struggle. Marx also believed Communism made sure that everyone had the means to survive; this allowed for safer working conditions and no social class inequality. The government was very involved with the distribution of resources. Although everyone was equal in society, many of the fundamental freedoms were abolished, such as the freedom of religion. The abolishment of many freedoms often led to a lack of individuality among the population.</h6>
