                    <h6>Britain was the first country to industrialize as it had many advantages over other countries in Europe. There were an abundance of natural resources and had a stable government that supported this change. The government encouraged internal trade and helped with the building of roads, canals, and harbors. It also provided stability among consumers and sellers. This allowed Britain to have a monopoly on inventions as they forced colonies to buy goods that were produced by their factories.</h6>
