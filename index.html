Working conditions were just as bad as they had very long shifts, an unsanitary environment and was quit unsafe. Women and children were sent as coal miners, as a result they took in coal dust introduced coal lung also known as black lung disease.

The Working Class were slowly being taken over by machines, as a result the Luddites realiated by destroyed many factories.

                    <h6>As energy sources began to evolve, new developments were made. Human and animal power evolved into water and windmills, while giant water wheels and coal fueled the development of the steam engine. As a result of these energy sources, factories were built, resulting in the Textile Industry. The Spinning Jenny, Arkwright's Water Frame, and the Cotton Gin were among the many inventions.

There were an abundance of natural resources and had a stable government that supported this change.
